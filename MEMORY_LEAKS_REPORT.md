# Memory Leak Analysis Report
**Interactive Cosmic Anomaly Audio-Reactive Visualizer**

Generated: 2025-11-05

## Executive Summary

This report identifies **12 critical memory leaks** that should be fixed to ensure stability during multi-hour live VJ performances, particularly for drum & bass shows. These leaks can cause browser crashes, degraded performance, and visual stuttering over extended runtime.

---

## Critical Memory Leaks Identified

### 1. **Settings UI Event Listeners Not Cleaned Up** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Location**: `src/settings-ui.js`
**Severity**: HIGH - Causes accumulating listeners on repeated initialization

**Issue**: The `settings-ui.js` file has 19 addEventListener calls but only 9 removeEventListener calls. The `cleanupSettingsUI()` function exists but does not remove all listeners.

**Impact**:
- Event listeners accumulate each time settings UI is reinitialized
- Memory leaks grow proportionally to number of reinitializations
- Can cause hundreds of duplicate event handlers over time

**Affected Code Pattern**:
```javascript
// Many addEventListener calls like:
element.addEventListener('input', handler);
element.addEventListener('change', handler);
// But cleanupSettingsUI() doesn't remove all of them
```

**Fix Required**:
1. Store all event handler references in a tracked list
2. Ensure `cleanupSettingsUI()` removes ALL event listeners
3. Use tracked listener pattern like in `preset-library-window.js`

**Files to Update**: `src/settings-ui.js`

---

### 2. **Canvas Texture Memory Not Released** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Location**: `src/scene.js:173-195`
**Severity**: HIGH - Canvas contexts accumulate in memory

**Issue**: The `createGlowTexture()` function creates canvas elements for texture generation but never releases them. The canvas reference is stored in `texture.userData._sourceCanvas` but is never cleaned up when the texture is disposed.

**Code**:
```javascript
function createGlowTexture(size = 256) {
  const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
  // ... canvas setup ...
  const texture = new THREE.CanvasTexture(canvas);
  // Store canvas reference but never clean it up
  texture.userData._sourceCanvas = canvas;
  return texture;
}
```

**Impact**:
- Each texture creation allocates ~256KB of canvas memory
- Canvas contexts are never released even when texture.dispose() is called
- Multiple theme changes accumulate unreleased canvases
- Can leak 10-50MB over a long session

**Fix Required**:
1. Add custom dispose method to texture that clears canvas
2. Or manually clean up canvas when texture is disposed
3. Consider texture pooling/reuse for performance

**Files to Update**: `src/scene.js`

---

### 3. **HDR Texture Loader Memory Leak** ⚠️ HIGH
**Location**: `src/scene.js:1100-1230` (theme change functions)
**Severity**: MEDIUM-HIGH - RGBELoader instances accumulate

**Issue**: `RGBELoader` instances are created for HDR background loading but are not disposed. Three.js loaders can hold references to internal caches and buffers.

**Code Pattern**:
```javascript
function loadHdrEnvironment(url) {
  const loader = new RGBELoader(); // Created but never disposed
  loader.load(url, (texture) => {
    // Use texture
  });
}
```

**Impact**:
- Each theme change creates a new RGBELoader
- Loaders hold internal cache references
- Can leak 5-10MB per loader instance over time

**Fix Required**:
1. Reuse a single RGBELoader instance
2. Or explicitly dispose loaders after use
3. Clear loader cache if available

**Files to Update**: `src/scene.js`

---

### 4. **Aubio Buffer Pool Unbounded Growth** ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Location**: `src/audio.js:1789-1822`
**Severity**: MEDIUM - Buffer pool grows without limit in some edge cases

**Issue**: The Aubio buffer pool has a cap of 6 buffers per size, but the pool itself (Map keyed by size) can grow unbounded if many different buffer sizes are used.

**Code**:
```javascript
_releaseAubioScratch(buffer) {
  const size = buffer.length;
  let pool = this._aubioBufferPool.get(size);
  if (!pool) {
    pool = [];
    this._aubioBufferPool.set(size, pool); // Can accumulate many sizes
  }
  if (pool.length >= 6) return;
  pool.push(buffer);
}
```

**Impact**:
- Map grows with each unique buffer size encountered
- In extreme cases, could have 50+ different sizes cached
- Each buffer is 512 samples (~2KB) but accumulation adds up

**Fix Required**:
1. Add maximum Map size (e.g., 10 different sizes)
2. Use LRU eviction for least-used buffer sizes
3. Add periodic cleanup of unused sizes

**Files to Update**: `src/audio.js`

---

### 5. **Live Audio Ring Buffer Memory Leak** ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Location**: `src/audio.js:1516-1529`
**Severity**: MEDIUM - Large buffer reallocations not freed

**Issue**: The live audio ring buffer is reallocated when size changes but the old buffer is not explicitly nulled until next reallocation, potentially delaying garbage collection.

**Code**:
```javascript
_ensureLiveBuffer() {
  const desiredLength = Math.max(1, Math.floor(sr * this._liveBufferSec));
  if (!this._liveBuffer || this._liveBuffer.length !== desiredLength) {
    this._liveBuffer = new Float32Array(desiredLength); // Old buffer orphaned
  }
}
```

**Impact**:
- Buffer can be up to 30 seconds of audio (5.8MB at 48kHz)
- Multiple rapid source changes can temporarily leak old buffers
- Garbage collector may delay collection

**Fix Required**:
1. Explicitly null old buffer before reallocation
2. Add buffer size change throttling
3. Consider reusing buffers when size decreases

**Files to Update**: `src/audio.js`

---

### 6. **Diagnostics Console Memory Accumulation** ✅ PARTIALLY FIXED
**Location**: `src/main.js:694-741`
**Severity**: LOW - Already has mitigation but can be improved

**Issue**: Console logging for diagnostics mode can accumulate unbounded history in browser DevTools, causing memory issues over multi-hour runs.

**Current Mitigation**:
- Auto-disables after 5 minutes or 100 logs
- Clears console every 20 samples
- Uses compact logging

**Remaining Issue**: Console clear may be blocked in some environments, causing accumulation to continue.

**Recommended Improvements**:
1. Add localStorage logging as alternative when console clear fails
2. Disable diagnostics by default in production builds
3. Add memory usage monitoring to diagnostics output

**Files to Update**: `src/main.js`

---

### 7. **Preset Manager Event Listener Accumulation** ⚠️ LOW
**Location**: `src/preset-library-window.js:52-70`
**Severity**: LOW - Good pattern but verify all listeners tracked

**Issue**: The preset library window tracks event listeners but there's a potential race condition if the window is closed during render.

**Code**:
```javascript
render() {
  if (!this.win || this.win.closed) return;
  // Remove old event listeners before re-rendering
  this._removeAllTrackedListeners();
  // ... but what if window closes during this?
}
```

**Impact**:
- Minor: listeners could leak if window closes mid-render
- Unlikely in practice but possible

**Fix Required**:
1. Add try-catch around listener removal
2. Verify window.closed state before each operation
3. Add defensive null checks

**Files to Update**: `src/preset-library-window.js`

---

### 8. **Meyda Instance Not Disposed** ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Location**: `src/audio.js:2063-2066`
**Severity**: MEDIUM - Meyda instances hold circular references

**Issue**: Meyda instances (`this._meydaInstance`, `this._meydaInstanceStereo`) are set to null in dispose() but Meyda may have internal cleanup methods that aren't called.

**Code**:
```javascript
dispose() {
  // ...
  this._meydaInstance = null; // Just nulled, not properly disposed
  this._meydaInstanceStereo = null;
}
```

**Impact**:
- Meyda may hold references to audio nodes
- Circular references could prevent garbage collection
- Each instance ~1-2MB

**Fix Required**:
1. Check if Meyda has `.dispose()` or `.destroy()` methods
2. Call cleanup before nulling
3. Verify no lingering references

**Files to Update**: `src/audio.js`

---

### 9. **Performance Pads HUD Styles Accumulation** ⚠️ LOW
**Location**: `src/performance-pads.js:463-501`
**Severity**: LOW - Style element duplication prevented but verify

**Issue**: HUD installation checks for existing styles, but if cleanup fails and controller is recreated, styles could duplicate.

**Code**:
```javascript
_installHud() {
  if (!document.getElementById('perf-hud-styles')) {
    const style = document.createElement('style');
    style.id = 'perf-hud-styles';
    // ... but what if removal failed earlier?
  }
}
```

**Impact**:
- Multiple style elements with same ID (impossible but defensive check needed)
- Minimal memory impact but poor practice

**Fix Required**:
1. Remove existing style element if found during cleanup
2. Add more defensive checks
3. Verify parent node before removal

**Files to Update**: `src/performance-pads.js`

---

### 10. **WebSocket Reconnection Backoff Not Reset** ⚠️ LOW
**Location**: `src/main.js:279-306`
**Severity**: LOW - Backoff delay increases without bound

**Issue**: WebSocket backoff multiplier (featureWsBackoffMs) increases exponentially but is capped at 20 seconds. However, the lockout mechanism could cause timing drift over very long sessions.

**Code**:
```javascript
featureWsBackoffMs = Math.min(20000, Math.max(2500, featureWsBackoffMs * 1.6));
// Eventually reaches 20s and stays there, but lockout timing could drift
```

**Impact**:
- Minor timing drift in reconnection logic
- Not a true memory leak but could cause performance issues
- Connection attempts may be delayed more than intended

**Fix Required**:
1. Add periodic backoff reset after successful connection
2. Verify lockout timing doesn't accumulate
3. Add connection success counter

**Files to Update**: `src/main.js`

---

### 11. **Particle Geometry Capacity Growth** ⚠️ LOW
**Location**: `src/scene.js:262-305, 385-417`
**Severity**: LOW - Geometries grow by 25% but never shrink

**Issue**: Particle geometries have a capacity that grows by 25% when more particles are needed, but they never shrink when fewer particles are used later.

**Code**:
```javascript
const growthFactor = 1.25;
const newCapacity = Math.ceil(Math.max(particleCount, capacity * growthFactor));
// Grows but never shrinks back down
```

**Impact**:
- Memory usage ratchets up over theme changes
- Each particle geometry can be 100KB-1MB
- Not a leak per se but suboptimal memory usage

**Fix Required**:
1. Add shrink threshold (e.g., if using <50% capacity)
2. Reallocate smaller geometry when appropriate
3. Or accept current behavior as acceptable tradeoff

**Files to Update**: `src/scene.js`

---

### 12. **Essentia Worker Message Handler Race Condition** ⚠️ LOW
**Location**: `src/audio.js:1929-1957`
**Severity**: LOW - Worker message handler not cleared immediately

**Issue**: Essentia worker's `onmessage` handler is set but not cleared immediately on dispose, relying on 100ms delayed termination.

**Code**:
```javascript
_initEssentiaWorker() {
  this._essentiaWorker.onmessage = (event) => this._handleEssentiaMessage(event);
  // Later in dispose():
  this._essentiaWorker.postMessage({ type: 'shutdown' });
  setTimeout(() => {
    workerRef.onmessage = null; // Cleared after 100ms delay
    workerRef.terminate();
  }, 100);
}
```

**Impact**:
- Message handler could receive messages during shutdown
- Handler references parent class, preventing GC
- 100ms window where leak exists

**Fix Required**:
1. Clear onmessage immediately in dispose()
2. Add flag to ignore messages during shutdown
3. Reduce or eliminate termination delay

**Files to Update**: `src/audio.js`
